Abstract:
In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonorthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) networks with the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Based on the estimated channel state information in an uplink training phase,
the base station precodes the confidential information using zero-forcing precoding. Following this, the ergodic secrecy rate of each user 
equipment is analytically derived in the downlink data transmission. Computer simulations are performed to validate the correctness of 
our analysis. Discussions on the impacts of different system parameters on the secrecy performance are also provided.
